This project is part of a collaborative effort with Pixeltree Inc. to build a more transparent future. Our objective is to transform political activities into clear and compliant data that may be used to develop further insights.

The program will be given a url as an input. It should retuen a JSON output of all the contents of the HTML document. Take a look at an example input:
[example meeting minutes](https://pub-calgary.escribemeetings.com/Meeting.aspx?Id=9a27aea6-df27-4322-907f-164396fcf3b0&Agenda=PostMinutes&lang=English).
All the data we need is in this structured HTML. All we need to do is take out the information and return it in a JSON. **Implement with Python.**

Find more meeting minutes here: [meeting minutes dir](https://pub-calgary.escribemeetings.com/?Expanded=Audit%20Committee&Year=2022)

### What we want

- the UID of the meeting (found in the URL) (e.g. `9a27aea6-df27-4322-907f-164396fcf3b0`)
- who is present in the meeting
- who is present in roll call (check out the image below; these are the people that are able to vote)
